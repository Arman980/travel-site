    <p>For us, Armenia isn't what one can see on glossy postcards. Armenia is a hidden treasure, 
      it's in every rock and tree, river and lake, house and street, village and town, in every glass of wine raised to friendship and in every smile on people's faces.</p>

    <p>Armenia is small in size, it occupies an area of about 30000 square kilometers. And yet Armenia is very diverse. 
      The country is different in the north, south and center. The north, with its lush green forests and serene landscapes is a place to soothe your mind and soul.
      Its meditative tranquility boosts the creative force within. The south of Armenia, with its ancient historical and spiritual sites , symbolizes our unbroken spirit. 
        The center of Armenia, a link between the north and south, is the heart of the country, the source of origin of Armenian art and culture.</p>
